      Calgary, a city located in the province of Alberta, is home to a variety
      of bird species. One such species is the pelican, which can be found in
      and around the city's many bodies of water.
    </p>

    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>
      Pelicans are found near large bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and
      coasts. In Calgary, they can be seen around the Bow River and the Glenmore
      Reservoir. These bodies of water provide a rich source of food for the
      pelicans, as well as a place to rest and breed. The city's temperate
      climate also provides a suitable habitat for the birds.

      Pelicans can also be found at the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary, a protected
      wetlands area located in the city. The sanctuary is home to a variety of
      bird species, including pelicans, and serves as an important stopover
      point for migratory birds.

    <h2>Feeding Patterns</h2>

      Pelicans are known for their distinctive hunting technique, in which they
      form a line and swim in a coordinated fashion to corral fish into shallow
      water. They then dip their large beaks into the water to scoop up their
      prey. They also have a pouch under their beak that can hold up to three
      gallons of water, which they use to help swallow their food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pelicans are opportunistic feeders and will eat a variety of fish, as well
      as crustaceans and other aquatic animals. They have keen eyesight and can
      spot their prey from a distance, making them highly effective hunters.
    </p>

    <h2>Mating Habits</h2>
    <p>
      Pelicans are social birds and often mate for life. During the breeding
      season, they build nests out of sticks and twigs and lay eggs, which are
      incubated by both the male and female. The male will often bring food to
      the female while she is incubating the eggs, and both parents will take
      turns incubating the eggs and keeping them warm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the chicks hatch, both parents help to feed and care for them until
      they are old enough to fend for themselves. The chicks are fed a special
      secretion produced by the adult pelicans, called "pigeon milk," which is
      high in fat and protein and helps them grow.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    Pelicans are very interesting creatures and have many interesting facts
    about them. Here are a few!
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pelicans are among the largest birds in the world, with a wingspan of up
        to 10 feet. This makes them one of the most impressive birds to see in
        flight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Despite their large size, they are surprisingly agile in the air and can
        reach speeds of up to 35 mph while flying. This allows them to easily
        maneuver to catch their prey.
      </li>
      <li>
        They have a lifespan of up to 20 years in the wild. This is longer than
        many other bird species, and allows them to form long-lasting bonds with
        their mates and offspring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pelicans are known for their distinctive appearance, with a long, flat
        beak and large, puffed-up throat pouch. This pouch is used for both
        hunting and storing food, and can expand to accommodate large amounts of
        prey.
      </li>
      <li>
        In some parts of the world, pelicans are considered a symbol of good
        luck. This is due to their association with the sea, which has long been
        a source of abundance and prosperity.
